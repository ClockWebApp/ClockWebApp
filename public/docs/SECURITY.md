<h2>Legacy Versions</h2>
<p>All versions pre v2.0.0 are no longer supported and will no longer recieve any form of support as they're based off of a now unsupported code base so it is recommended that old versions are immediately updated as it will avoid risks of attackers getting into the system.</p>
<h2>Beta Builds</h2>
<p>These are never supported and are not even meant to be used as public releases. They're just to see what new features are coming and being worked on so they're not covered by the policy. These versions will not recieve updates as they're not main releases of the App.</p>
