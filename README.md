# Clock
## Clock is an Open Source Web API. 
Its primary function is to be used in Web based Operating Systems for mobile or desktop devices to tell the time, it can be integrated into the OS and save time for the developers who want to work on more important things. Clock API is easy to edit to a programmers needs but changes by a third party developer will not carry other to future updates when they are relesed and are downloaded. If you are interested in integrating this into your OS or any project that a clock is needed for download the latest version from the GitHub page and FULL credit must be given but if you request my permission to use it before hand credit is not needed. It is currently in development but releases are availible for use.

## Want to make changes?

With this beogn an Open Source project we highly encourage you to change it to your liking but credit still must be given with a simple 'Powered by Clock API'
