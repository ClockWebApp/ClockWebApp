# Clock Web App

## What is Clock Web App?

Clock App is an Open Source web app developed for beign used in Web based OS. It is powerful and feature rich giving consumers and developers a good experience with intuitive UI. Code is formatted clearly and commented to allow developers to make changes and edit the code to fit with their OS.

## Is it Open Source?

100% Yes! Anyone can download and edit the code. If you add a feature that you think the main version should have submit the code in a feature request and it will be added in 1 - 2 updates time if it is good and credit will be given. Check the license for more details.

If you edit the code then implement it into your OS change the build info, where it says '(Official Build)' replace it with your name / company name

## How do i submit a bug report / feature request?

Go to the GitHub Repositorie (https://github.com/SpicyPTV/ClockWebApp) and click on the issues tab, once there create a new issue. Then you must select between three options:

### Bug report
Create a report to help us improve

### Feature request
Suggest an idea for this project

### Report a security vulnerability
Please review our security policy for more details

Once you have chosen fill out ALL* of the information and I will fix the issue within 1 - 2 updates. Feature requests will only be implemented if I think it is good enough and credit will be given to the requestor but if you are a programmer and have added the feature in yourself to a version you have dowloaded please submit code along with it as it will be easier to implement.

*You must fill out all the information or the report will be ignored

## How often is it updated?

Every 2 or 3 months a new update is released but in between every update beta versions are released giving previews of what is to come in the next Update. We do not recommend putting beta versions in your OS unless you really want to as they can be unstabble and have bugs or glitches

Next Update: DELAYED (Possible release April 15th 2021)

## How can I use Clock App in my OS?

Download the most recent release from the GitHub page and copy the 'index.html', 'style.css' and 'main.js' files and paste them in your apps folder in the OS. Then you can edit the code to how you like it or just leave it but make sure to check for updates on the GitHub page
