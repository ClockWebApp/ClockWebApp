# Clock Web App

## What is Clock Web App?

Clock App is an Open Source web app developed for beign used in Web based OS. It is powerful and feature rich giving consumers and developers a good experience with intuitive UI. Code is formatted clearly and commented to allow developers to make changes and edit the code to fit with their OS.

## Is it Open Source?

100% Yes! Anyone can download and edit the code. If you add a feature that you think the main version should have submit the code in a pull request and it will be added in 1 - 2 updates time if it is good and credit will be given. Check the license for more details.

If you edit the code then implement it into your OS change the build info, where it says '(Official Build)' replace the official with your name / company name 

## How do I submit a bug report / feature request?

Go to the GitHub Repositorie (https://github.com/SpicyPTV/ClockWebApp) and click on the issues tab, once there create a new issue. Then you must select between three options available.

Once you have chosen fill out *ALL of the information and I will fix the issue within 1 - 2 updates. Feature requests will only be implemented if I think it is good enough and credit will be given to the requestor but if you are a programmer and have added the feature in yourself to a version you have dowloaded please submit in a pull request instead as it will be easier to implement.

*You must fill out all the information or the report will be ignored

## How often are updates released?

Updates will come out regularly but major updates will come out every 3 months or so but many patches with small features and improvements will come out in between. Beta versions may also be released but these are unstable and we recommend you do not add them to your OS or Website but just use them to get an idea as to what is coming next. I am working on a feature coming out in 1.1.2 that will alert you if there is a new update available in the app itself instead of through GitHub

Exciting news! After a long delay v1.1.0 is releasing April 5th and is amazing, it's filled with features and updates such as:
1. A timer
2. A stopwatch
3. An alarm system
4. Revamped settings
5. An analog clock along with the current digital one
6. Completely new UI that looks amazing

And there are some bug fixes / tweaks added as well:

1. Alert Boxes will now close them selves after 5 seconds
2. Fully resizable UI that works on all devices

Next Update: April 5th 2021

## How can I use Clock Web App in my OS / website?

Download the most recent release from the GitHub page and copy the 'index.html', 'style.css' and 'main.js' files and paste them in your apps folder in the OS. Then you can edit the code to how you like it or just leave it but make sure to check for updates on the GitHub page
