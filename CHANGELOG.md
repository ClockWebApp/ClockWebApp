# Changelog

## What is a change log?

A change log is a list of features added or removed from all updates in a project. This changelog features all updates for the API and does not include public BETA builds even tough they can be downloaded on the GitHub page. This is because many features in those builds get removed or heavily changed and BETA builds are not supported and should not be used in official use as they are not coveredin our security policy.
